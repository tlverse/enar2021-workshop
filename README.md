# `tlverse` workshop at CSP 2020 [![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tlverse/csp2020-workshop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tlverse/csp2020-workshop) [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tlverse/csp2020-workshop/master?urlpath=rstudio)

Welcome to the GitHub repository accompanying a 1-day workshop on Targeted
Learning with the `tlverse` software ecosystem, given at the Conference on
Statistical Practice (CSP), February 20, 2020. Much of the materials here are
based on an early draft of the (eventually forthcoming) book **The Hitchhiker's
Guide to the `tlverse`, or a Targeted Learning Practitioner's Handbook**, by
Mark van der Laan, Jeremy Coyle, Nima Hejazi, Ivana Malenica, Rachael Phillips,
and Alan Hubbard. For a work-in-progress draft of the unabridged book, please
see https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook or the associated GitHub repository at
https://github.com/tlverse/tlverse-handbook.

Note: The Travis-CI continuous integration service currently deploys the
developmental version of these workshop material to the `gh-pages` branch of
this repository, which is hosted by GitHub Pages at
https://tlverse.org/csp2020-workshop.

The workshop materials are automatically built and deployed using
[Binder](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub), which supports using R
and RStudio, with libraries pinned to a specific snapshot on
[MRAN](https://mran.microsoft.com/documents/rro/reproducibility). An
RStudio session, pre-loaded with all the materials, is available via the "launch
binder" button at the top of this page.
