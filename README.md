# `tlverse` workshop at ENAR 2021 [![Booklet](https://github.com/tlverse/enar2021-workshop/actions/workflows/bookdown.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tlverse/enar2021-workshop/actions/workflows/bookdown.yml) [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tlverse/enar2021-workshop/master?urlpath=rstudio)

Welcome to the GitHub repository accompanying a full-day workshop on Targeted
Learning and the `tlverse` software ecosystem, given (virtually) at the [ENAR
2021 Spring Meeting](https://www.enar.org/meetings/spring2021/) on Sunday, March
14, 2021. These teaching materials are adapted from a draft of the forthcoming
book [*Targeted Learning in `R`: Causal Data Science with the `tlverse` Software
Ecosystem*](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook/), by Mark van der Laan, Jeremy
Coyle, Nima Hejazi, Ivana Malenica, Rachael Phillips, and Alan Hubbard. The
unabridged book is [freely available](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook), and
its source materials may be found in the corresponding public [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/tlverse/tlverse-handbook).

The workshop materials are automatically built and deployed using
[Binder](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub), which supports using R and
RStudio, with libraries pinned to a specific snapshot on
[MRAN](https://mran.microsoft.com/documents/rro/reproducibility). An RStudio
session, pre-loaded with all the materials, is available via the "launch binder"
button on this page; however, we recommend that you install the required R
packages (e.g., via the included [`install.R`
script](https://github.com/tlverse/enar2021-workshop/blob/master/install.R))and
run all examples locally.
