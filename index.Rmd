This is open source, reproducible vignette is for a full-day workshop on the
Targeted Learning framework for causal inference and machine learning, given at
the [ENAR 2021 Spring Meeting](https://www.enar.org/meetings/spring2021/) on
Sunday, 14 March 2021.  Beyond introducing Targeted Learning, the workshop
focuses on applying the methodology in practice using the [`tlverse` software
ecosystem](https://github.com/tlverse).  These materials are based on a working
draft of the book [*Targeted Learning in `R`: Causal Data Science with the
`tlverse` Software Ecosystem*](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook/), which
includes in-depth discussion of these topics and much more, and may serve as a
useful reference to accompany these workshop materials.

## Important links {-}

* __Software installation__: Please install the relevant software before the
  workshop using the [installation
  script](https://github.com/tlverse/enar2021-workshop/blob/master/install.R).

* You will probably exceed the GitHub API rate limit during this installation,
  which will throw an error. This issue and the solution are addressed
  [here](#installtlverse).

* __Code__: `R` script files for each section of the workshop are available via
  the GitHub repository for the workshop at
  https://github.com/tlverse/enar2021-workshop/tree/master/R

## About this workshop {-}

This full-day workshop will provide a comprehensive introduction to the field of
_Targeted Learning_ and the corresponding [`tlverse` software
ecosystem](https://github.com/tlverse). In particular, we will focus on targeted
minimum loss estimators of causal effects, including those of static dynamic,
optimal dynamic, and stochastic interventions. These multiply robust, efficient
plug-in estimators use state-of-the-art, ensemble machine learning tools to
flexibly adjust for confounding while yielding valid statistical inference.

In addition to discussion, this workshop will incorporate both interactive
activities and hands-on, guided `R` programming exercises, to allow participants
the opportunity to familiarize themselves with methodology and tools that will
translate to real-world data analysis. It is highly recommended for participants
to have an understanding of basic statistical concepts such as confounding,
probability distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and
regression. Advanced knowledge of mathematical statistics is useful but not
necessary.  Familiarity with the `R` programming language will be essential.

## About the instructors {-}

### Mark van der Laan {-}

Mark van der Laan, PhD, is Professor of Biostatistics and Statistics at UC
Berkeley. His research interests include statistical methods in computational
biology, survival analysis, censored data, adaptive designs, targeted maximum
likelihood estimation, causal inference, data-adaptive loss-based learning, and
multiple testing. His research group developed loss-based super learning in
semiparametric models, based on cross-validation, as a generic optimal tool for
the estimation of infinite-dimensional parameters, such as nonparametric density
estimation and prediction with both censored and uncensored data. Building on
this work, his research group developed targeted maximum likelihood estimation
for a target parameter of the data-generating distribution in arbitrary
semiparametric and nonparametric models, as a generic optimal methodology for
statistical and causal inference. Most recently, Mark's group has focused in
part on the development of a centralized, principled set of software tools for
targeted learning, the `tlverse`.

### Alan Hubbard {-}

Alan Hubbard is Professor of Biostatistics, former head of the Division of
Biostatistics at UC Berkeley, and head of data analytics core at UC Berkeley's
SuperFund research program. His current research interests include causal
inference, variable importance analysis, statistical machine learning,
estimation of and inference for data-adaptive statistical target parameters, and
targeted minimum loss-based estimation. Research in his group is generally
motivated by applications to problems in computational biology, epidemiology,
and precision medicine.

### Jeremy Coyle {-}

Jeremy Coyle, PhD, is a consulting data scientist and statistical programmer,
currently leading the software development effort that has produced the
`tlverse` ecosystem of R packages and related software tools. Jeremy earned his
PhD in Biostatistics from UC Berkeley in 2016, primarily under the supervision
of Alan Hubbard.

### Nima Hejazi {-}

Nima Hejazi is a PhD candidate in biostatistics, working under the collaborative
direction of Mark van der Laan and Alan Hubbard. Nima is affiliated with UC
Berkeley's Center for Computational Biology and NIH Biomedical Big Data training
program, as well as with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Previously,
he earned an MA in Biostatistics and a BA (with majors in Molecular and Cell
Biology, Psychology, and Public Health), both at UC Berkeley.  His research
interests fall at the intersection of causal inference and machine learning,
drawing on ideas from non/semi-parametric estimation in large, flexible
statistical models to develop efficient and robust statistical procedures for
evaluating complex target estimands in observational and randomized studies.
Particular areas of current emphasis include mediation/path analysis,
outcome-dependent sampling designs, targeted loss-based estimation, and vaccine
efficacy trials.  Nima is also passionate about statistical computing and open
source software development for applied statistics.

### Ivana Malenica {-}

Ivana Malenica is a PhD student in biostatistics advised by Mark van der Laan.
Ivana is currently a fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, after
serving as a NIH Biomedical Big Data and Freeport-McMoRan Genomic Engine fellow.
She earned her Master's in Biostatistics and Bachelor's in Mathematics, and
spent some time at the Translational Genomics Research Institute. Very broadly,
her research interests span non/semi-parametric theory, probability theory,
machine learning, causal inference and high-dimensional statistics. Most of her
current work involves complex dependent settings (dependence through time and
network) and adaptive sequential designs.

### Rachael Phillips {-}

Rachael Phillips is a PhD student in biostatistics, advised by Alan Hubbard and
Mark van der Laan. She has an MA in Biostatistics, BS in Biology, and BA in
Mathematics. A student of targeted learning and causal inference; her research
